        "# Overview Of Recommender Systems\n",
        "Recommender systems are therefore powerful information filtering tools that can facilitate personalized services and provide tailored experience to individual users. In short, recommender systems play a pivotal role in utilizing the wealth of data available to make choices manageable. \n",

        "# Collaborative Filtering\n",
        "This term has been enriched with more senses. In a broad sense, it is the process of filtering for information or patterns using techniques involving collaboration among multiple users, agents, and data sources. CF has many forms and numerous CF methods proposed since its advent. Overall, CF techniques can be categorized into: memory-based CF, model-based CF, and their hybrid. Representative memory-based CF techniques are nearest neighbor-based CF such as user-based CF and item-based CF. Memory-based CF has limitations in dealing with sparse and large-scale data since it computes the similarity values based on common items. Model-based methods become more popular with its better capability in dealing with sparsity and scalability. Many model-based CF approaches can be extended with neural networks, leading to more flexible and scalable models with the computation acceleration in deep learning. In general, CF only uses the user-item interaction data to make predictions and recommendations. Besides CF, content-based and context-based recommender systems are also useful in incorporating the content descriptions of items/users and contextual signals such as timestamps and locations\n",

        "# Explicit Feedback and Implicit Feedback\n",
        "To learn the preference of users, the system shall collect feedback from them. The feedback can be either explicit or implicit. Relatively speaking, implicit feedback is often readily available since it is mainly concerned with modeling implicit behavior such as user clicks. As such, many recommender systems are centered on implicit feedback which indirectly reflects userâ€™s opinion through observing user behavior. There are diverse forms of implicit feedback including purchase history, browsing history, watches and even mouse movements. For example, a user that purchased many books by the same author probably likes that author. Note that implicit feedback is inherently noisy. We can only guess their preferences and true motives. A user watched a movie does not necessarily indicate a positive view of that movie.\n",

        "# Recommendation Tasks\n",
        "A number of recommendation tasks have been investigated in the past decades. Based on the domain of applications, there are movies recommendation, news recommendations, point-of-interest recommendation and so forth. It is also possible to differentiate the tasks based on the types of feedback and input data, for example, the rating prediction task aims to predict the explicit ratings. Top- recommendation (item ranking) ranks all items for each user personally based on the implicit feedback.\n",

        "# Matrix Factorization\n",
        "Matrix Factorization is a well-established algorithm in the recommender systems literature. At that time, Netflix, a media-streaming and video-rental company, announced a contest to improve its recommender system performance. Although the final score was the result of an ensemble solution (i.e., a combination of many algorithms), the matrix factorization algorithm played a critical role in the final blend\n",
        "\n",
        "# The Matrix Factorization Model\n",
        "Matrix factorization is a class of collaborative filtering models. Specifically, the model factorizes the user-item interaction matrix (e.g., rating matrix) into the product of two lower-rank matrices, capturing the low-rank structure of the user-item interactions."
